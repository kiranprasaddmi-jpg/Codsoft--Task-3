DESCRIPTION:
Welcome to my calculator project! This task demonstrates my ability to build functional and interactive web applications using core front-end technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator features a clean, user-friendly interface capable of performing basic arithmetic operations with precision and responsiveness.

This project highlights my understanding of event handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. Special attention was given to usability, ensuring the interface is intuitive and accessible across devices. From layout structuring to implementing real-time button interactions, this project reflects my foundational knowledge in building logic-driven UI components.

Creating this calculator helped me strengthen my JavaScript skills and improved my ability to think programmatically while maintaining visual clarity. It serves as an essential building block in my journey as a front-end developer, reinforcing the connection between function, design, and user experience.
